# NT4-Neural-Net-Engine

Navigate to ./src/ and run builderman.bat, or builderman.sh depending on your OS. You'll need CMake installed and in your path. 

Inside the ./bin/ you'll find the engine if the above was successful.

The NT4.exe runs asynchronously as a standalone server. Use Control.py to interact with it. 

The documentation for using the text-server can be currently (still figuring this out) found at:
