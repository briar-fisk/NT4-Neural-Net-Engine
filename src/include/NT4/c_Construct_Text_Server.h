    \brief This is a handshake based text interface for the engine. 

    
    File-Based Command Control System for Asynchronous Standalone Neural-Net Engine Control:

    Text-Based Command Execution:
    - Commands are represented as text strings that specify actions or operations to be performed by the system or process.
    - Each command is associated with a specific functionality or operation within the system.

    File I/O:
    - Input and output operations are performed using files as the medium of communication.
    - Commands are read from input files, and outputs, returns, and status indicators are written to output files, though some commands do output to the console.
    - This method facilitates asynchronous communication between systems, as they can read from and write to files independently.

    Handshake Protocol:
    - A handshake protocol is used to establish communication or synchronize actions between systems.
    - In this context, a flag file serves as a mechanism for signaling the readiness or completion of certain operations, namely that the user has written a command sequence to 'Control_Panel.ssv' that is ready to be interpreted..
    - The content of the flag file is used to indicate the status of the control panel, allowing the system to either wait or act accordingly.

    Flag File:
    - A flag file is a small file used to signal the status or state of the system.
    - It typically contains simple data or metadata, such as a single value or indicator, to convey information. In the NT4 text interface it is a boolean value.
    - Flag files are used as synchronization primitives to coordinate activities between systems.

    Control Panel:
    - The control panel represents a set of commands or instructions that can be executed by the system or process.
    - It is stored in a separate file (e.g., Control_Panel.ssv), which contains a sequence of commands or directives to be processed.

    Interpretation and Execution:
    - The system interprets commands read from the control file (e.g., Control_Panel.ssv) and executes them sequentially.
    - Command execution may involve performing operations on data, manipulating the state of the system, or interacting with external resources.

    Status Checking and Control Flow:
    - The system periodically checks the status of a flag file (e.g., Control_Panel_Flag.ssv) to determine if there are new commands to execute or if certain operations have completed.
    - Based on the status indicated by the flag file, the system may initiate specific actions, continue processing, or wait for further instructions.

    Startup and 'autoexec.ssv':
    - For 'booting up' the system interprets the commands found in 'autoexec.ssv' sequentially. This allows for shell scripting a startup sequence.

    Custom Commands:
    - A script file placed in "./Scripts/" can be called by simply entering the filename as you would a command token. A file can call other files so you can create dependency hell for yourself if you wish, but with the added complexity of ML.
    
    \var string const RETURN_FILE defines the file in which returns write their data at this level of the API.

    \retval None This function doesn't return any values.

    This type is used for determining how to handle the node. You may want to set one to a treetop that way you can then write a charging function that has a different behavior for treetop nodes.

    Example Usage:

    Setting the type of node 66 to the value of 2 flagging it as a treetop node. Before and after setting the type we use output_Node_Raw to view the results. This assumes node 66 has two dendrites { 7, 14 }.

    The nodes keep track of which dendrite their upper connections are connected to by encoding them into respective "axon hillocks". Basically we take whichever dendrite index the connection is connected to and create an axonic group that represents those connections to legs of that index. This allows for advanced search of the networks including time-series and more.

    Example Usage:

    Adding an axonic connection to node 42 on axon hillock 5 of node 16 to represent that it is Dendrite[5] on the node above. We will use output_Node_Raw after setting the axon to show the result. This assumes no previous axonic connections or dendrites and it is a quanta bound state node with the state set to the uint64_t value 99.

        output_Node_Raw 16
        add_Axon_Index 16 42 5

    This is used during encoding and performing a query. It traverses the connections in the given NID's first axon hillock. For each of these connections it does a does_Lower_Connection_Exist to see if that node matches. By searching the first legs we keep the search limited to only those with the possiblity to match the search string of connections. We know this is the case because if the first node in a string of nodes has an upper tier connection then that gives us a connection to a node that at least shares index[0] with our current lower-tier node and by checking every other dendrite index of the upper tier node against the respective index in the passed node array we can know for sure if our current pattern exists yet. After checking all of the upper tier connections on axon hillock 0 if we come up with no confirmed connections we know that the current arrangement of nodes hasn't been encoded into a higher tier node symbol yet.

    Example Usage:

    We will use the example containing a set of nodes { 5 6 7 }, node 5 has 2 axonic connections with the second having the correct configuration of legs meaning we found it. This second node has the NID 75, we know node 75 has the correct connection so we output it manually to show the node data.

    \retval None This function doesn't return any values.

    At the interface between the networks internal node structure and the exterior information space exists the state tier, this is the interface where outside information binds to nodes to allow for communication coherently across the internal/external space. Outside you have the information to be encoded, this information is composed of differentiated information, the smallest piece of coherent information that the abstractions are built upon is the quanta. This quanta is a pixel, a character, an integer, a scalar value. A quantifiable and discrete piece of information which forms the basis of the patterns of information you will be encoding/decoding from the neural matrix. This doesn't have to be low level abstraction wise, only that is has a hash or scalar abstraction that can be cast to uint64. It could represent the hash of a full 3D body scan as easily as a scalar value from a thermal sensor.
    
    This function binds the state to the node to form the interface, an absolutely crucial function to the distributed symbol neural networks.

    Example Usage:

    /** Outputs the ugly raw info dump for the node.

        output_Node_Raw NID
    \param uint64_t NID The Node ID of the node who's information symbol is being output.
    \retval None This function doesn't return any values.

    This is pretty basic, outputs the node.

    Here is the breakdown of the components output:

    -Entire output node raw dump:

        Node_ID (NID): %NID% RC: %RC% Type: %Type% State { %State% } --- Dendrites: [%Dendrite_ID%] %Dendrites[%Dendrite_ID%]% --- Axon_Hillock_Count: %Axon_Hillock_Count% Axons[%Axon_Hillock_ID%] <%Axon_Count_For_Hillock%>: [%Axon_ID%] Axons[%Axon_Hillock_ID%][%Axon_ID%]

    - The NID is the node ID within the network of nodes.

        Node_ID (NID): %NID% 

    - The RC is the reinforcement counter, the reinforcement value, the neuroplasticity analogue, the post-synaptic-cleft density approximation.

        RC: %RC% 

    - The type of node, see set_Node_Type for more information.

        Type: %Type% 

    - The pattern of input quanta that the node represents, the hierarchically encoded sensory trace, the abstract symbol built from the recomposition of the input states into the complete encoded pattern.

        State { %State% } 

    - The "lower" connections to nodes that form sub-symbols of the current node's symbol.

        Dendrites: [%Dendrite_ID%] %Dendrites[%Dendrite_ID%]% 

    - The number of axon hillocks on this node, the number of axonal hillocks is determined by the position of upper tier connections. If an upper tier axonic connection makes contact with dendritic index 4 then this lower node will have 5 axon hillocks so that number 4 can hold this connection preserving the information of the upper tier connection index without having to query the other node to get the respective position. This is used during the function which check for upper tier nodes and during some charging methodologies.

        Axon_Hillock_Count: %Axon_Hillock_Count% 
        
    - If the node contains axonic connections they will be iteratively printed here. For each hillock the number of axons on it will be printed followed by the individual axonic connections.

        Axons[%Axon_Hillock_ID%] <%Axon_Count_For_Hillock%>: [%Axon_ID%] Axons[%Axon_Hillock_ID%][%Axon_ID%]


    Example Usage:

    In this example we have encoded the pattern "64 128 256" into a many to one construct. In this example the nodes 1-9 have already been created so our first node will be NID 10. This results in 4 nodes created, 3 state tier nodes { 10, 11, 12 } and 1 upper tier treetop node { 13 }. We will output all the nodes using this function to show state, treetop, dendritically connected, and axonically connected nodes..

        output_Node_Raw 10
        output_Node_Raw 11
        output_Node_Raw 12
        output_Node_Raw 13

    Output:

        Node_ID (NID) 10 RC: 1 Type: 0  State { 64 } --- Dendrites:  --- Axon_Hillock_Count: 1  Axons[0] <1>: 13
        Node_ID (NID) 11 RC: 1 Type: 0  State { 128 } --- Dendrites:  --- Axon_Hillock_Count: 2  Axons[0] <0>:  Axons[1] <1>: 13
        Node_ID (NID) 12 RC: 1 Type: 0  State { 256 } --- Dendrites:  --- Axon_Hillock_Count: 3  Axons[0] <0>:  Axons[1] <0>:  Axons[2] <1>: 13
        Node_ID (NID) 13 RC: 1 Type: 2  State { 0 } --- Dendrites:  [0] 10 [1] 11 [2] 12 --- Axon_Hillock_Count: 0

    This function may seem pointless at first, but it is used in conjunction with the CAN scaffolds and others to output a compact visualizatin of a series of nodes by their NID. Though there is overlap when typecasting NIDs the variation is enough that the human can see differences in different permutations of encoded input.

    Example Usage:
    
    In this example we have encoded the pattern "64 128 256" into a many to one construct. In this example the nodes 0 - 175 have already been created so our first node will be NID 176. The node bound to state 128 already exists with a NID 65. This results in 3 nodes created, 2 state tier nodes { 176, 177 } and 1 upper tier treetop node { 178 }. We will output all the nodes using this function to show a small example of the potential output used to convey variance int he NID structure at a glance.

    This is used during encoding and performing a query. It traverses the connections in the given NID's first axon hillock. For each of these connections it does a does_Lower_Connection_Exist to see if that node matches. By searching the first legs we keep the search limited to only those with the possiblity to match the search string of connections. We know this is the case because if the first node in a string of nodes has an upper tier connection then that gives us a connection to a node that at least shares index[0] with our current lower-tier node and by checking every other dendrite index of the upper tier node against the respective index in the passed node array we can know for sure if our current pattern exists yet. After checking all of the upper tier connections on axon hillock 0 if we come up with no confirmed connections we know that the current arrangement of nodes hasn't been encoded into a higher tier node symbol yet.

    Example Usage:

    We will use the example containing a set of nodes { 5 6 7 }, node 5 has 2 axonic connections with the second having the correct configuration of legs meaning we found it. This second node has the NID 75, we know node 75 has the correct connection so we output it manually to show the node data.

In this example the NID of the new node is 150. We see this NID in the return file.

    in this example we have a single trace encoded which is composed of 5 integers, { 11, 22, 33, 44, 55 }. This results in 6 nodes which we will see in the output. 5 state tier nodes, one for each input integer, and one higher tier node. Remember, NID 0 exists, but it is the NULL node not to be used.

	/** Encodes the current input of the given Construct.

        encode CONSTRUCT_ID
    \param int CONSTRUCT_ID The construct that encapsulates the state space to use when encoding.
    \retval None This function doesn't return any values.

    This encodes the p_Input data, if the nodes aren't found they are created, used for training. How it does this is determined by what type of construct it is. Different constructs can have different structures depending on whether they are many to one, 2d pyramidal, 3d pyramidal, stiched based, etc.

    To encode a construct you must first have input loaded into it. Once the input is loaded then calling this will encode the input pattern into a construct. The way to use this is to first get input to the construct, then you tell it to encode the input, then you can use gather, output, and other functions to access the results.:

         Get Input: set_Input | set_Input_uint | load_Input
         Do something with the Input: encode
         Get your Output: gather_X | output_X 

    Example Usage:

    - First we create a construct of the type Many_To_One named ExaCon for Example Construct.
    - Then we use set_Input_uint to load the uint array { 10, 15, 20 } into ExaCon's input.
    - After the input is set we call encode on ExaCon, which is construct ID [0].
    - We then use output_Scaffold to view the encoded trace.
    - This example is a Many_To_One, which means all state nodes (Tier[0]) are connected to a single upper tier (Tier[1]) treetop node.

    Error Handling:

    - No error handling is implemented in this function.

    Additional Notes:

    - Whitespace is weird when doing text input through set_Input! It reads from the text file using "file >> tmp_Variable", then this variable is concatenated to the others, "full_Variable = full_Variable + " " + tmp_Variable. If the next token is the '/end/' tag it does not append whitespace to the token, so 'set_Input 0 10 /end/' would only input '10' not '10 '. This full string is then read in as input and the network evaluates each character including spaces, even though whitespace was ignored in tokenization. This means that if you are trying to search for multiple tokens in a single string you need to be aware that spaces between the words may cause false positive associations due to the space or other whitespace. The greenscreen masking technique detailed in set_Input can be used to handle this behavior through input formatting only. So be aware these two behaviours stack to form a strange and peculiar action.

        query CONSTRUCT_ID
    \param int CONSTRUCT_ID The construct that encapsulates the state space to search.
    \retval None This function doesn't return any values, the data resulting from this function is handled through traces.

    This sets up the scaffold as encode does, but it doesn't create nodes if they aren't found, they remain NULL in the scaffold, this we call a NULLCAN

    Used for querying the network, you input, fill the NULLCAN, charge the network, then gather the outputs. Does not create new nodes, only finds if they already exist or not, does not "train" only "evaluates".

    Suggested for use before encoding (if using learning mode and not locked_to_initial_training_mode) otherwise it will also find the current trace as the perfect match.

    To query a construct you must first have input loaded into it. Once the input is loaded then calling this will query the input pattern for a given construct. The way to use this is to first get input to the construct, then you tell it to evaluate the input, then you can use gather, output, and other functions to access the results.:

         Get Input: set_Input | set_Input_uint | load_Input
         Do something with the Input: query
         Get your Output: gather_X | output_X

    Example Usage:

    This example is a Many_To_One, which means all state nodes (Tier[0]) are connected to a single upper tier (Tier[1]) treetop node.

    You may notice that all the names are lowercase, this is because 'R' and 'r' are different symbols, so making them all lowercase keeps them using the same 'letters'.

    First we create a construct of the type Many_To_One named ExaCon for Example Construct.
    
        register_Construct Many_To_One ExaCon

    Then we use set_Input + encode to load several character names into the network and encode them as a base set, see encode for further details.
    
        set_Input 0 randolph carter /end/ encode 0
        set_Input 0 harley warren /end/ encode 0

        set_Input 0 edward norrys /end/ encode 0
        set_Input 0 king kuranes /end/ encode 0

    After we have the base character names we can begin searching them. We set the input to the string 'i' to search names that have 'i' in them.
    
        set_Input 0 i

    To call this function and the correct construct we use 'query 0', this fills the NULLCAN and handles the neural cascades.
    
        query 0

    We then use 'output_Scaffold' to view the NULLCAN showing the tiny CAN holding the current queries, 'gather_Output 0' to output the resulting traces to the output file for Construct [0] (default ".\Output\CONSTRUCT_NAME.Output.ssv").
    
        output_Scaffold 0
        gather_Output 0

    To show different searches we do several searches with a newline in the output between them.

    Search for 'a':

        output_Newline 0
        set_Input 0 a
        query 0

    Error Handling:

    - No error handling is implemented in this function.

    Additional Notes:
    - Use characters or numbers that you know won't appear in the dataset to create a "greenscreen" over your input for the network. This is due to the NULLCAN, where a node that isn't found is set to NULL on the CAN scaffold, and subsequently is skipped during charging as there is nothing to charge. Alternatively just use the query_Given_Legs command.
    - Whitespace is weird when doing text input through set_Input! It reads from the text file using "file >> tmp_Variable", then this variable is concatenated to the others, "full_Variable = full_Variable + " " + tmp_Variable. If the next token is the '/end/' tag it does not append whitespace to the token, so 'set_Input 0 10 /end/' would only input '10' not '10 '. This full string is then read in as input and the network evaluates each character including spaces, even though whitespace was ignored in tokenization. This means that if you are trying to search for multiple tokens in a single string you need to be aware that spaces between the words may cause false positive associations due to the space or other whitespace. The greenscreen masking technique detailed in set_Input can be used to handle this behavior through input formatting only. So be aware these two behaviours stack to form a strange and peculiar action.

        query_Spacial CONSTRUCT_ID
    \param int CONSTRUCT_ID The construct that encapsulates the state space to search.
    \retval None This function doesn't return any values, the data resulting from this function is handled through traces.

    This query is used when the position of the input relative to the rest matters. Such as in time series searches, or context dependent inputs. The input position determines which connections get charged, this allows for searching nodes based on both the state of the input and the position.

    This would be useful for things such as time-series prediction, such as stock data or an environmental variable. 

    Example Usage:

    - Example 1.

    If we were trying to predict temperatures based on the previous temperatures and their fluctuations we might use this function. For example, if we have the current set of temperatures as { 50, 55, 60 } then we would want to know what comes after 60. First though we'll encode a sample history to search through.

    Here's the sample history:

        50 55 60 65 70 70 65 60 55 50

    We'll do this by encoding 3 temperatures at a time starting at the beginning of the sample history.

        register_Construct Many_To_One ExaCon
        set_Input_uint 0 5 3 50 55 60
        encode 0
        set_Input_uint 0 5 3 55 60 65
        encode 0
        set_Input_uint 0 5 3 60 65 70
        encode 0
        set_Input_uint 0 5 3 65 70 70
        encode 0
        set_Input_uint 0 5 3 70 70 65
        encode 0
        set_Input_uint 0 5 3 70 65 60
        encode 0
        set_Input_uint 0 5 3 65 60 55
        encode 0
        set_Input_uint 0 5 3 60 55 50
        encode 0

    Assuming we encoded 3 temperatures at a time we can create a prediction by setting the first two indexes and searching "forward".

    So we input the set { 55, 60 } for the first two numbers, then search using this query_Spacial.

        set_Input_uint 0 5 2 55 60
        query_Spacial 0
        gather_Output_uint 0

    This means that only patterns with 55 as position [0], and 60 as position [1] will be found. This means those found will have position [2] as the "next" temperature.

    Output:

        6 20 2 3 55 60 65
        12 10 2 3 65 60 55

    We may choose to evaluate them through simple averaging the predicted index (number [2]). Or, alternatively we can weight them based on charge, or both.

    In this case we can choose the trace with the charge of 20 for our prediction, which is { 55, 60, 65 }

    A pure average would return 60, so trace selection is an important aspect that goes beyond this simple example. The choice on how to select the traces and filter them can make or break an algorithm.

    So we take our current input and add the new trace to get a prediction:

        55 60 ?? <- Current, the ?? is the index we are searching for, the prediction.
        55 60 65 <- Found
        =
        55 60 65 <- Resulting predicted pattern.

    - Example 2.

    For an example that hopefully illistrates the purpose of this function we can walk through searching for a string when you know only a couple characters and their position in the string. Pretend you are sleuthing around online hunting down pedo scum, suddenly discord dings, a message! One of your contacts has a lead, a screenshot from a twitch stream with the kingpin distributor you've been tracking for a while now. He's in this twitch chat, you know that avatar, but there's a problem. The chat animations have caused a cloud of emoji to be doubleing over the name right as the screenshot was taken. You have only the second and third characters, 'aw', but it is a lead.

    So we have the clue to work on [ '?' 'a' 'w' '?' ]. We know 'aw' are the second and third character, and the first char is a mystery, as are the rest if they even exist, which is liklely given how short that username would be.

    Luckily you have a dataset of usernames to look through, we'll train these into the network (obviously we are using a completely insufficient number but we aren't including 10k usernames here), then search the network using our clue.

    One thing to note, we have these usernames from sites we've scraped, and they have characters not allowed in the name. This means we can take our knowledge of how the network works and use this by inputting characters that cannot appear in usernames like a "greenscreen" in the string. The network during query doesn't create nodes, and if the username network never has these illegal characters encoded to a node then we will sure we are only searching for our intended characters, as no nodes will be in the scaffold for the invalid ones to charge.

    Code for our initial dataset, notice some names such as Flawless1337 do not have the 'aw' in the right spot:

    After the dataset we setup the query and submit it, using the 'illega' character of '_' to create "NULLCAN" nodes, which are positions in the current active node (CAN) scaffold, the datastructure which corrdinates encoding and charging, which don't have a node, therefore are "NULLCAN" nodes.

    Gather the output traces into the "./Output/ExaCon.ssv" file.

    Put a newline in the output file so we can tell the difference between the two queries we are doing. Two queries to compare this function to the 'normal' query.

        output_Newline 0

    The input is still set to "_aw" so we don't have to reinput our string. We can instead call 'query 0' because the prep work is all done. We then gather the output as normal with 'gather_Output 0'.

    - Example 3.

    There may be times when you have a set number of inputs and you want to search for any patterns with that state in that spot. For example, you have your input set from your greenhouse sensors, oxygen, carbon dioxide, temperature, humidity, etc.

    Each of these is an row in your input list:

    -# Oxygen
    -# Carbon Dioxide
    -# Temperature
    -# Humidity
    -# Etc

    They are read in as a string of values 1 - 5, "O2 Co2 Temp Hum Etc", and example with values may be "2 4 2 1 3" to give an idea what an input list might look like to the neural network.

    So you encode each list, each snapshot, once every hour or so as your standard datakeeping, in fact it is automated. We'll use these made up snapshots for an example dataset:

        register_Construct Many_To_One ExaCon <- Don't forget to register the construct.
        set_Input 0 3 2 4 1 5 /end/ encode 0
        set_Input 0 2 3 3 2 4 /end/ encode 0
        set_Input 0 4 1 2 5 3 /end/ encode 0
        set_Input 0 5 4 3 2 1 /end/ encode 0
        set_Input 0 1 5 2 4 3 /end/ encode 0
        set_Input 0 3 2 1 4 5 /end/ encode 0
        set_Input 0 4 3 2 5 1 /end/ encode 0
        set_Input 0 1 4 3 2 5 /end/ encode 0
        set_Input 0 2 3 4 1 5 /end/ encode 0
        set_Input 0 5 1 2 3 4 /end/ encode 0
        set_Input 0 3 4 2 1 5 /end/ encode 0
        set_Input 0 2 1 3 5 3 /end/ encode 0
        set_Input 0 4 5 1 2 3 /end/ encode 0
        set_Input 0 1 2 3 4 5 /end/ encode 0
        set_Input 0 3 2 5 1 4 /end/ encode 0
        set_Input 0 2 3 4 5 1 /end/ encode 0
        set_Input 0 4 5 2 3 1 /end/ encode 0
        set_Input 0 5 1 3 2 4 /end/ encode 0
        set_Input 0 1 4 5 3 2 /end/ encode 0
        set_Input 0 3 2 4 5 1 /end/ encode 0
        set_Input 0 2 1 5 3 3 /end/ encode 0
        set_Input 0 4 3 1 2 5 /end/ encode 0
        set_Input 0 5 4 2 1 3 /end/ encode 0
        set_Input 0 1 5 4 3 2 /end/ encode 0
        set_Input 0 3 2 1 5 4 /end/ encode 0
    
    Now, your boss comes in one day and says they need some data for a research project. They want every snapshop that has a humity value of 3 (everything here is 1 - 5 in range for simplicity) and a O2 of 2.

    So you formulate your input string, using the greenscreen illegal character mask again, where the first and last are set to '2' and '3' respectively: "2 _ _ _ 3". There is a major issue with this that may not be apparent right away, the spaces are counted as valid symbols by the network. So we need to invalidate them as well to remove them from the query, "2_______3"

    This is because the input array is treated as an array of characters, with the caveat that extra whitespace is ignored and condensed down to a single space, ' ', which can be odd if not expected.

        set_Input 0 2_______3 /end/

    Then use this query_Spacial function & gather the output:

        query_Spacial 0
        gather_Output 0

    Which gives us the output:

         8 10 2 9 2 3 3 2 4
        15 10 2 9 2 3 4 1 5
        18 20 2 9 2 1 3 5 3 <- The charge here is [20] because both of the nodes were found in the right location.
        22 10 2 9 2 3 4 5 1
        27 20 2 9 2 1 5 3 3
         9 10 2 9 4 1 2 5 3
        11 10 2 9 1 5 2 4 3
        19 10 2 9 4 5 1 2 3
        29 10 2 9 5 4 2 1 3

    To further this example we will search for a temperature with a value of 1, and humidity of 4 to see what was going on when it was a wee bit chilly with high humidity.

    First we output a newline to the file to separate our searches, then we set the input. After setting the input we can then query_Spacial and gather_Output as normal.

        output_Newline 0
        set_Input 0 ____1___4 /end/
        query_Spacial 0
        gather_Output 0

    This gives the following output:

        12 10 2 9 3 2 1 4 5
        19 10 2 9 4 5 1 2 3
        28 10 2 9 4 3 1 2 5
        31 20 2 9 3 2 1 5 4 <- This appears to be the only really good match.
         8 10 2 9 2 3 3 2 4
        16 10 2 9 5 1 2 3 4
        21 10 2 9 3 2 5 1 4
        24 10 2 9 5 1 3 2 4

    Using this you can selectively search your traces.

    Error Handling:

    - No error handling is implemented in this function.

    Additional Notes:

    - Use characters or numbers that you know won't appear in the dataset to create a "greenscreen" over your input for the network. This is due to the NULLCAN, where a node that isn't found is set to NULL on the CAN scaffold, and subsequently is skipped during charging as there is nothing to charge. Alternatively just use the query_Given_Legs command.
    - Whitespace is weird when doing text input through set_Input! It reads from the text file using "file >> tmp_Variable", then this variable is concatenated to the others, "full_Variable = full_Variable + " " + tmp_Variable. If the next token is the '/end/' tag it does not append whitespace to the token, so 'set_Input 0 10 /end/' would only input '10' not '10 '. This full string is then read in as input and the network evaluates each character including spaces, even though whitespace was ignored in tokenization. This means that if you are trying to search for multiple tokens in a single string you need to be aware that spaces between the words may cause false positive associations due to the space or other whitespace. The greenscreen masking technique detailed in set_Input can be used to handle this behavior through input formatting only. So be aware these two behaviours stack to form a strange and peculiar action.

    This is used when you have multiple inputs to the same index that you want to check. For example, maybe you want to check for traces grouped around one end the temperature scale rather than a single value.
    
    Example Usage:

    - Example 1.

    Following up on the idea of checking a range of thermometer readings from the description we have this example. If your temperature gauge registers 1 -5 then in this example you might want to look up the super-symbols, the encoded traces, the upper tier nodes, that have 4 & 5 encoded onto the index corresponding to temperature on your greenhouse input array.

    Here is an example input set from our example greenhouse sensors, oxygen, carbon dioxide, temperature, humidity, etc.

    Each of these is an row in your input list:

    -# Oxygen
    -# Carbon Dioxide
    -# Temperature <- We'll be searching this index for the temperature ranges using this function query_Given_Index
    -# Humidity
    -# Etc

    They are read in as a string of values 1 - 5, "O2 Co2 Temp Humidity Etc", and example with values may be "2 4 2 1 3" to give an idea what an input list might look like to the neural network.

    So you encode each list, for this example we'll say your greenhouse controller automatically logs these input lists. We'll use some of this log data for an example dataset:

        set_Input 0 1 5 4 3 2 /end/ encode 0
        set_Input 0 3 2 1 5 4 /end/ encode 0

    Now we need to find the temperatures, the { 4, 5 }. We do this by setting the input appropriately. 

    To formulate the input strings we create an input string from out input indexes with no whitespace between them, this is because each one is the smallest unit of information so we don't risk losing any by placing characters next to each other. Being single digit values 1-5 we can do that with this string based input:

        45

    This 45 is represented as a string internally so each digit is a separate integer value even though a human reads it as forty-five.

    Then formulate it into the set_Input string for the construct 0 (ExaCon as defined using 'register_Construct Many_To_One ExaCon' above) we are working with:

        set_Input 0 45 /end/

    Finally we query the network with 'query_Given_Index' to search the network for all traces containing one of { 4, 5 } on leg 4, which corresponds to 4. Temperature, so index/leg/dendrite/axon_hillock #4. You might wonder why we are setting it to index 4 and not 2 like one would expect. This is because we have to count each whitespace as an index in the input string, "1 2 3 4 5" equals '1' + ' ' + '2' + ' ' + '3' + ' ' + '4' + ' ' + '5'. 
    
    Here is the query string:
    
        query_Given_Index 0 4

    Then use 'gather_Output' to get the output:

        gather_Output 0

    Output:

    Contents of "./Output/ExaCon.Output.ssv":

         7 10 2 9 3 2 4 1 5
        15 10 2 9 2 3 4 1 5

        25 10 2 9 1 4 5 3 2
        27 10 2 9 2 1 5 3 3

    - Example 2.

    This example builds on the above one to search for temperatures matching 1, 2, & 3.

        set_Input 0 123 /end/

    Then the query and gather:

        query_Given_Index 0 4
        gather_Output 0

    Output:

        24 10 2 9 5 1 3 2 4

    - Example 3.

    In this example we basically redo the same environmental search again, but this time we'll use the uint interface.

    Start with encoding, but with uint and the syntax that requires (set_Input_uint CONSTRUCT_ID COUNT INPUT ):

        register_Construct Many_To_One ExaCon <- Don't forget to register the construct.
        set_Input_uint 0 5 3 2 4 1 5 encode 0
        set_Input_uint 0 5 2 3 3 2 4 encode 0
        set_Input_uint 0 5 4 1 2 5 3 encode 0
        set_Input_uint 0 5 5 4 3 2 1 encode 0
        set_Input_uint 0 5 1 5 2 4 3 encode 0
        set_Input_uint 0 5 3 2 1 4 5 encode 0
        set_Input_uint 0 5 4 3 2 5 1 encode 0
        set_Input_uint 0 5 1 4 3 2 5 encode 0
        set_Input_uint 0 5 2 3 4 1 5 encode 0
        set_Input_uint 0 5 5 1 2 3 4 encode 0
        set_Input_uint 0 5 3 4 2 1 5 encode 0
        set_Input_uint 0 5 2 1 3 5 3 encode 0
        set_Input_uint 0 5 4 5 1 2 3 encode 0
        set_Input_uint 0 5 1 2 3 4 5 encode 0
        set_Input_uint 0 5 3 2 5 1 4 encode 0
        set_Input_uint 0 5 2 3 4 5 1 encode 0
        set_Input_uint 0 5 4 5 2 3 1 encode 0
        set_Input_uint 0 5 5 1 3 2 4 encode 0
        set_Input_uint 0 5 1 4 5 3 2 encode 0
        set_Input_uint 0 5 3 2 4 5 1 encode 0
        set_Input_uint 0 5 2 1 5 3 3 encode 0
        set_Input_uint 0 5 4 3 1 2 5 encode 0
        set_Input_uint 0 5 5 4 2 1 3 encode 0
        set_Input_uint 0 5 1 5 4 3 2 encode 0
        set_Input_uint 0 5 3 2 1 5 4 encode 0

    For the input search string we use the uint format of stating the number of elements and our inputs, so 'set_Input 45 /end/' becomes 'set_Input_uint 2 4 5':

        set_Input 0 2 4 5

    The different input methods result in different input indexes for the values, meaning our query is different. The uint version gives us the intuitive index of [2] for our temperature because each number is a sequential input, rather than input - space - input:

        query_Given_Index 0 2

    We gather using the uint interface so it outputs the integers to the textfile properly:

        gather_Output_uint 0

    Output:

    Contents of "./Output/ExaCon.Output.ssv":

         6 10 2 5 3 2 4 1 5
        14 10 2 5 2 3 4 1 5
        21 10 2 5 2 3 4 5 1
        25 10 2 5 3 2 4 5 1
        29 10 2 5 1 5 4 3 2
        20 10 2 5 3 2 5 1 4
        24 10 2 5 1 4 5 3 2
        26 10 2 5 2 1 5 3 3

    - Example Meta-Explanation:

    The difference in the node IDs is due to the string interface not encoding the ' ' as the second character. With the input set of 'n n n n n', and each 'n' being a value 1-5, this means the second index in the string will be ' ' and read in as NID[2]. You can compare the patterns between the string version and the uint version to see the data is the same, but the node IDs are off by one:

    String version 'set_Input':

         7 10 2 9 3 2 4 1 5
        15 10 2 9 2 3 4 1 5
        22 10 2 9 2 3 4 5 1
        26 10 2 9 3 2 4 5 1
        30 10 2 9 1 5 4 3 2
        21 10 2 9 3 2 5 1 4
        25 10 2 9 1 4 5 3 2
        27 10 2 9 2 1 5 3 3

    uint Version 'set_Input_uint':

         6 10 2 5 3 2 4 1 5
        14 10 2 5 2 3 4 1 5
        21 10 2 5 2 3 4 5 1
        25 10 2 5 3 2 4 5 1
        29 10 2 5 1 5 4 3 2
        20 10 2 5 3 2 5 1 4
        24 10 2 5 1 4 5 3 2
        26 10 2 5 2 1 5 3 3


    Error Handling:

    - No error handling is implemented in this function.

    Additional Notes:

    - Use characters or numbers that you know won't appear in the dataset to create a "greenscreen" over your input for the network. This is due to the NULLCAN, where a node that isn't found is set to NULL on the CAN scaffold, and subsequently is skipped during charging as there is nothing to charge. Alternatively just use the query_Given_Legs command.
    - Whitespace is weird when doing text input through set_Input! It reads from the text file using "file >> tmp_Variable", then this variable is concatenated to the others, "full_Variable = full_Variable + " " + tmp_Variable. If the next token is the '/end/' tag it does not append whitespace to the token, so 'set_Input 0 10 /end/' would only input '10' not '10 '. This full string is then read in as input and the network evaluates each character including spaces, even though whitespace was ignored in tokenization. This means that if you are trying to search for multiple tokens in a single string you need to be aware that spaces between the words may cause false positive associations due to the space or other whitespace. The greenscreen masking technique detailed in set_Input can be used to handle this behavior through input formatting only. So be aware these two behaviours stack to form a strange and peculiar action.

    \param int CONSTRUCT_ID The construct that encapsulates the state space to search.
    \param int LEG_COUNT The number of legs you are passing.
    \param bool LEGS  The array of legs as boolean values used to determine whether or not to charge nodes connected on that axon_hillock/dendrite_index.
    \retval None This function doesn't return any values, the data resulting from this function is handled through traces.

    This function works by taking this set of 'legs' which is a boolean array. It then takes every input of the construct and puts them in a pool of unorganized nodes. It then steps through the boolean array checking whether that step needs to be charged or not. If it needs charged the program then steps through every node in the pool having it charge any axons on the current index, which would be the axon_hillock to the node.

    So if we are on the second leg in the array then we would step through each node, go check the axon_hillock population count, and if any are found we charge them into the charging buffers. 
    
    This means you will search for the set of inputs you give, not in order but individually, on the legs you specify.

    Example Usage:

    - Example 1.

    In this example we'll use the scenario of running a game server such as Minecraft and needing to track down some hackers. You have the chatlogs which are immense, and you have the user account database. One of your mods remembers that the hacker had an x or z in the first character or four of their name.

    Using this function we can search for { 'X', 'Z', 'x','z' } on the first 4 characters of each name. So to start we need to encode the database of names by formatting them with the set_Input command:

        register_Construct Many_To_One ExaCon /end/ encode 0
        set_Input 0 PotatoChipCrunch /end/ encode 0
        set_Input 0 NotARealIdentity /end/ encode 0
        set_Input 0 BabyDollXOXO /end/ encode 0
        set_Input 0 SpaceCowboy /end/ encode 0
        set_Input 0 NinjaGuy22 /end/ encode 0
        set_Input 0 ElectroExile /end/ encode 0
        set_Input 0 ArcaneAdventurer /end/ encode 0
        set_Input 0 Xx_KawaiiAngel_xX /end/ encode 0
        set_Input 0 FireDragon99 /end/ encode 0
        set_Input 0 ProUser2024 /end/ encode 0
        set_Input 0 MySpaceStar /end/ encode 0
        set_Input 0 RealNameJane /end/ encode 0
        set_Input 0 xXx_P0t4t0Ch1p_xXx /end/ encode 0
        set_Input 0 PixelPilgrim /end/ encode 0
        set_Input 0 d4t4b4s3Qu33n /end/ encode 0
        set_Input 0 NeonNomad /end/ encode 0
        set_Input 0 ByteBandit23 /end/ encode 0
        set_Input 0 DataMinerX /end/ encode 0
        set_Input 0 -R4v3n-Cl4w- /end/ encode 0
        set_Input 0 G1tGuD /end/ encode 0
        set_Input 0 d00d!3_H4xx0r /end/ encode 0
        set_Input 0 -MysticMoon- /end/ encode 0
        set_Input 0 Vyrail_Vyxian /end/ encode 0
        set_Input 0 xX_D@rk_P@ssw0rd_Xx /end/ encode 0
        set_Input 0 8BitCh4rm3r /end/ encode 0
        set_Input 0 $p4c3C@d3t /end/ encode 0
        set_Input 0 W1z4rd0f0s /end/ encode 0
        set_Input 0 C0mm@nd_L1n3_H3ro /end/ encode 0
        set_Input 0 ScriptKiddieSupreme /end/ encode 0

    Now that we have the database to search we can formulate the input query, punch it, and gather the output.

        set_Input 0 XZxz /end/
        query_Given_Legs 0 4 1 1 1 1
        gather_Output 0

    Output:

    Contents of "./Output/ExaCon.Output.ssv":

        44 20 2 17 Xx_KawaiiAngel_xX
        59 30 2 18 xXx_P0t4t0Ch1p_xXx <- Notice how this one had 3 matches to the character pool 'XZxz' in the searched string "xXx_"
        78 20 2 19 xX_D@rk_P@ssw0rd_Xx
        60 10 2 12 PixelPilgrim
        86 10 2 10 W1z4rd0f0s

    - Example 2.

    Building on the previous example we have another mod say he saw one of them with a '-' or '_' so we'll expand the search:

        set_Input 0 Xx-_ /end/
        query_Given_Legs 0 4 1 1 1 1
        output_Newline 0
        gather_Output 0

    Output:

    Contents of "./Output/ExaCon.Output.ssv":

        44 30 2 17 Xx_KawaiiAngel_xX
        59 40 2 18 xXx_P0t4t0Ch1p_xXx <- With the addition of the '_' to the pool of states we find that this "xXx_" now has a match on all characters evaluated. Making the charge 40.
        78 30 2 19 xX_D@rk_P@ssw0rd_Xx
        60 10 2 12 PixelPilgrim
        68 10 2 12 -R4v3n-Cl4w-
        73 10 2 12 -MysticMoon-

    - Example 3.

    If we examine the last example we find the charges are dependent on the number of matches. 
    
    The query treats the input as a pool of states, rather than an input string. This means that an input with repeated characters or states will evalaute them each time it encounters them.

    Using this you can "weigh" inputs manually. If we want to weight the '-' character we cna input it multiple times like this:

        set_Input 0 Xx-----_ /end/ <- We input the '-' character 5 times.
        output_Newline 0
        query_Given_Legs 0 4 1 1 1 1
        gather_Output 0

    Output:

    Contents of "./Output/ExaCon.Output.ssv":

        44 30 2 17 Xx_KawaiiAngel_xX
        59 40 2 18 xXx_P0t4t0Ch1p_xXx
        78 30 2 19 xX_D@rk_P@ssw0rd_Xx
        60 10 2 12 PixelPilgrim
        68 50 2 12 -R4v3n-Cl4w-
        73 50 2 12 -MysticMoon-

    Notice how the last two have charges of 50 vs the previous example where they had 10? With Many_To_One constructs the upper tier node charge is directly proportionate to how many inputs are linked to it (and modified by weights and such but you get the point).

    This treetop is the top node in the current CAN Scaffold. So if you encode "yargi blargi" then this treetop node in a Many_To_One construct would be on tier [1] of the CAN Scaffold at index [0] that represents "yargi blargi".

    Example Usage:

    First we encode a string into a Many_To_One:

        register_Construct Many_To_One ExaCon
        set_Input 0 Pull Your Circuit Breaker /end/
        encode 0

    Then we can get output the scaffold so you can see it, and then get the treetop:

        output_Scaffold 0
        get_Treetop 0

    Output:

         --==   CAN_Scaffold   ==--

    /** Sets the index for the given Construct state_Node_Tree

    \param CONSTRUCT_ID The construct who's state node tree you are setting.
    \param INDEX The index you are setting the state tree to.
    \retval None This function doesn't return any values.

    Sets the index for the given Construct state_Node_Tree in the c_Node_Network::State_Nodes  fractal state tree array. This keeps the state spaces separate and discrete. Most networks you don't want to share state nodes. Some you do, that's where this function comes in, allows you to point a construct to the state tree you want.

    It is important to remember that the state tree indices and the constructs don't line up. Construct[1] likely doesn't have State_Tree[1]!

    Example Usage:

    Create 2 constructs to work with, we'll be pointing ConExa's State Tree at ExaCon's State Tree:

        register_Construct Many_To_One ExaCon
        register_Construct Many_To_One ConExa

    Set the ConExa to ExaCon:

        set_State_Nodes_Index 1 1

    Encode a string into ExaCon & output the scaffold, then encode a similar one in ConExa & output the scaffold. Comparing these you can see the shared nodes underneath.

        set_Input 0 Control_String Variable /end/
        encode 0
        output_Scaffold 0

        set_Input 1 Control_String New_Data /end/
        encode 1
        output_Scaffold 1

    All constructs share the underlying node network, so those NIDs are unique to the entire network, not just a single construct. This means when you see the same node in both scaffolds you are seeing the exact same node.

    Output:

    Construct[0]:

    \param CONSTRUCT_ID The construct who's input you wish to set.
    \param INPUT_STRING The input string, either terminates from endl, or the token '/end/'
    \retval None This function doesn't return any values.

    The sub-string '/end/' can be used as a string terminator. This is useful when you want to string multiple commands together, otherwise anything after the input command would be considered input. 'set_Input 0 Example_Text encode 0' would end up setting construct [0]'s input to 'Example_Text encode 0' and nothing would be encoded.

    Use this function to set the input of the construct you'll be either encoding or evaluating, or both.
    
    Use characters or numbers that you know won't appear in the dataset to create a "greenscreen" over your input for the network. This is due to the NULLCAN, where a node that isn't found is set to NULL on the CAN scaffold, and subsequently is skipped during charging as there is nothing to charge. Alternatively just use the query_Given_Legs command.
    
    Whitespace is weird when doing text input through set_Input! It reads from the text file using "file >> tmp_Variable", then this variable is concatenated to the others, "full_Variable = full_Variable + " " + tmp_Variable. If the next token is the '/end/' tag it does not append whitespace to the token, so 'set_Input 0 10 /end/' would only input '10' not '10 '. This full string is then read in as input and the network evaluates each character including spaces, even though whitespace was ignored in tokenization. This means that if you are trying to search for multiple tokens in a single string you need to be aware that spaces between the words may cause false positive associations due to the space or other whitespace. The greenscreen masking technique detailed in set_Input can be used to handle this behavior through input formatting only. So be aware these two behaviours stack to form a strange and peculiar action.

    Example Usage:

    - Example 1.

    We'll register a construct, then set the input, then output the input so we can see it.

    Example Usage:

    - Example 1.

    Imagine we have an array of unsigned integers representing the number of deaths a team has in a video game. Say 4 players:

        register_Construct Many_To_One ExaCon
        set_Input_uint 0 4 3 10 12 87
        output_Input_uint 0

    Be warned, this function treats the entire file as one input, it ignored newlines. Iterating through it loads each whitespace separated token into a string, "tmp_Full = tmp_Full + ' ' + tmp_Current_Token"

    Example Usage:

    To start with we register our construct:

        register_Construct Many_To_One ExaCon

    We create the input file for it and put our sample data into the file:

    Contents of "./Input/ExaCon.Input.ssv":

        yo ho ho
        and
        a
        bottle
        of
        rum

    Now using load_Input we can load this into the construct:

        load_Input 0
    
    And we can see the results:

    Example Usage:

    The first step is to encode a pattern, into a newly minted construct for this example though it doesn't have to be new, it can be an old heirloom construct passed down through the generations:

        register_Construct Many_To_One ExaCon
        set_Input 0 The Dream Quest of Unkown Kadath /end/
        encode 0
        output_Scaffold

    Which shows us:

    Output:

          [0]  <> 1

          [31]  <> 2
        <- Tier[1] ->
          [0]  <> 21

    From this we can see the upper tier node is '21'. So we tell it to retrieve that node, however, we create a new construct and get the node through that construct to show that as long as the construct is the same type we can retrieve patterns encoded into the nodes:

        register_Construct Many_To_One RandomCon
        gather_Given_Node 1 21

    /** This outputs the patterns as an array of uint64_t when given a node ID (NID).

        gather_Given_Node_uint CONSTRUCT_ID NID

    \param CONSTRUCT_ID The ID of the construct to use for gathering the node, the output will go to the output file associated with the construct given.
    \param NID The node ID (NID) of the node who's pattern we will be gathering, or decoding.
    \retval string This function write the string represented by the given NID to an output file associated with the given Construct.

    This is used when you want to retrieve a pattern from a NID as an array of uint64_t.

    Example Usage:

    In this example we will encode two lower tier constructs to get the NIDs, and feed them into an MSC and get a single treetop node that represents the super-symbol of all the input encoded into a single retrievable trace. We wil then use this to get the original input patterns back out.

    3 networks must be crafted with care, two raw tier constructs, and one higher multi-sensory construct (MSC):

        register_Construct Many_To_One ExaCon
        register_Construct Many_To_One ConExa
        register_Construct Many_To_One ExaMSC

    Now we'll encode the two raw constructs ExaCon and ConExa. ExaCon will be temperature, and ConExa will be oxygen:

        set_Input 0 Temperature: 2 /end/
        encode 0
        set_Input 1 Oxygen: 4 /end/
        encode 1

    Then we use gather_Treetop_Node function to get both treetops, and to output the raw node for each so we can see the full data to confirm this function works:

        gather_Treetop_NID 0
        output_Newline 0
        gather_Treetop_Node 0

        gather_Treetop_NID 1
        output_Newline 1
        gather_Treetop_Node 1

    Contents of "./Output/ExaCon.Output.ssv":

        12
        12 2 14 1 2 3 4 2 5 6 7 8 5 2 9 10 11 0 14 Temperature: 2

    Contents of "./Output/ConExa.Output.ssv":

        22
        22 2 9 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 0 9 Oxygen: 4

    Now that we have these { 12, 22 } we can move onto the multi-sensory construct:

        set_Input_uint 2 2 12 22
        encode 2

    Gather the output:

        gather_Treetop_NID 2
        output_Newline 2
        gather_Treetop_Node_uint 2

    Contents of "./Output/ExaMSC.Output.ssv":

        25
        25 2 2 23 24 0 2 12 22

    FINALLY we can use this function to get the information back out, starting by wiping the output files:

        clear_Output 0
        clear_Output 1
        clear_Output 2

    Now we get the pattern from our highest abstraction, the treetop from ExaMSC, NID number 25. Moving forward we will only use information retrieved from the network to reconstruct symbol #25, no previous trained knowledge we will use, only meta and structural:

        gather_Given_Node_uint 0 25

    Which gives us the file contents (in ExaCon! Which isn't the construct which encoded the pattern, to show the network is shared):

    Contents of "./Output/ExaCon.Output.ssv":

        25 2 2 23 24 0 2 12 22

    Looking at this trace we see { 2 12 22 } at the end, which means 2 elements, which are 12 & 22 repectively.

    We then output newline, gather the node 12, another newline, then the node 22. We use the default gather_Given_Node here to get the raw data, but we've shown the uint by using it to get this far:

        output_Newline 0
        gather_Given_Node 0 12
        output_Newline 0
        gather_Given_Node 0 22

    Results found in "./Output/ExaCon.Output.ssv":

        25 2 2 23 24 0 2 12 22
        12 2 14 1 2 3 4 2 5 6 7 8 5 2 9 10 11 0 14 Temperature: 2
        22 2 9 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 0 9 Oxygen: 4

    As you can see we have encoded and retrieved all patterns using this function for the MSC traces, and the gather_Given_Node for the raw.

    - No error handling is implemented in this function.

    - None.

    \retval c_Node Treetop  The treetop is output to the output file associated with the given construct.

    This returns the treetop node for a given construct and outputs it to the output file for the given construct.

    This treetop is the top node in the current CAN Scaffold. So if you encode { 111, 222, 333 } then this treetop node in a Many_To_One construct would be on tier [1] of the CAN Scaffold at index [0] that represents { 111, 222, 333 }.

    Example Usage:

    First we encode a string into a Many_To_One:

        register_Construct Many_To_One ExaCon
        set_Input_uint 0 3 111 222 333
        encode 0

    Then we can get the treetop:

        gather_Treetop_Node_uint 0

        4 2 3 1 2 3 0 3 111 222 333

    \param CONSTRUCT_ID The construct to retrieve the treetop node ID (NID) from.
    \retval uint64_t This function appends the NID of the treetop to the output file for the given construct.

    This function is useful when you are encoding multi-sensory constructs. When you encode a raw tier construct (one that deals with raw "sensory" data from outside the neural graph through state tier binding) the treetop is an abstraction of that sensory input. This function allows you to get a handle on that abstraction, a reference to that super-symbol.

    With this super-symbol or higher level abstraction you can feed it into higher tier constructs to build abstractions of abstractions with multiple lower constructs feeding their treetops into a higher tier construct.

    Example Usage:

    In this example we will encode two lower tier constructs to get the NIDs, and just for fun we'll feed them into an MSC to get a single treetop node that represents the super-symbol of all the input encoded into a single retrievable trace.

    First we create 3 networks, our old fren ExaCon, the somewhat familiar ConExa, and the rarely seen ExaMSC.

        register_Construct Many_To_One ExaCon
        register_Construct Many_To_One ConExa
        register_Construct Many_To_One ExaMSC

    Now we'll encode the two raw constructs ExaCon and ConExa. ExaCon will be temperature, and ConExa will be oxygen:

        set_Input 0 Temperature: 5 /end/
        encode 0
        set_Input 1 Oxygen: 3 /end/
        encode 1

    Output:

    The first construct ExaCon, temperature:

         --==   CAN_Scaffold   ==--
        <- Tier[0] ->
          [0]  <> 1
          [1]  <> 2
          [2]  <> 3
          [3]  <> 4
          [4]  <> 2
          [5]  <> 5
          [6]  <> 6
          [7]  <> 7
          [8]  <> 8
          [9]  <> 5
          [10]  <> 2
          [11]  <> 9
          [12]  <> 10
          [13]  <> 11
        <- Tier[1] ->
          [0]  <> 12


    The second construct ConExa, oxygen:

         --==   CAN_Scaffold   ==--
        <- Tier[0] ->
          [0]  <> 13
          [1]  <> 14
          [2]  <> 15
          [3]  <> 16
          [4]  <> 17
          [5]  <> 18
          [6]  <> 19
          [7]  <> 20
          [8]  <> 21
        <- Tier[1] ->
          [0]  <> 22

    Then we use this function to get both treetops, and to output the raw node for each so we can see the full data to confirm this function works:

        gather_Treetop_NID 0
        output_Newline 0
        gather_Treetop_Node 0

        gather_Treetop_NID 1
        output_Newline 1
        gather_Treetop_Node 1

    Output:

    Contents of "./Output/ExaCon.Output.ssv":

        12
        12 2 14 1 2 3 4 2 5 6 7 8 5 2 9 10 11 0 14 Temperature: 5

        22
        22 2 9 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 0 9 Oxygen: 3

    Now that we have these { 12, 22 } we can move onto the multi-sensory construct:

        set_Input_uint 2 2 12 22
        encode 2
        output_Scaffold 2

    Gather the output:

        gather_Treetop_NID 2
		output_Newline 2
		gather_Treetop_Node_uint 2

    Example Usage:

    First we register the construct, then we encode a series of binary values just because:

        register_Construct Many_To_One ExaCon
        set_Input 0 000 /end/ encode 0
